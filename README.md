# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This project was prepared as part of the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree programme. It was used to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Content
  - datasets
	  - train.csv: Titanic train data;
	  - test.csv: Titanic test data;
  - css
	- bootstrap.min.css: Bootstrap css used in html file
  - images : folder containing the images used in html file
  - index.html: html page with an article about this project
  - Kaggle Competition - Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster.ipynb: jupyter notebook used for read the datasets, processing the data, create the model and generate the submission file;
  
## Results
I created a machine learning model that predicts if a passenger survived or not to the Titanic. I submitted the submission file to Kaggles's competition and I obtained a a score of 0.78229 of accuracy.
